                    Mansaf is associated with a traditional Jordanian culture based on an agro-pastoral lifestyle in which meat and yogurt are readily available. Mansaf is served on special occasions such as weddings, births and graduations, or to honor a guest, and on major holidays such as Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, Christmas, Easter and Jordan's Independence Day. It is traditionally eaten collectively from a large platter in the Bedouin and rural style, standing around the platter with the left hand behind the back and using the right hand instead of utensils.
                    Since mansaf was originally popular among Bedouins, much of the traditions that they used with the dish still exist today. The tray containing mansaf is placed on a table where people gather around it while standing. Mansaf should be eaten with the use of a person's right hand only while the left is behind the person's back. The hand is used to create balls of rice and then the ball is placed in the mouth through the use of three fingers. It is frowned upon to blow on the ball of rice, no matter how hot. Many of these traditions are still used; however, it can also be eaten with spoons and plates.</p>
                    <h1 class="mansaf">Jordan's national dish:</h1>
                    <p>Though mansaf is frequently referred to as Jordan's "national dish", Massad states that mansaf is not a truly "traditional" dish, but is rather a more recent dish which was developed during the Hashemite-Mandatory era of the early 20th century, and then promulgated as a "national" dish following independence. Massad notes that the current form of mansaf differs from the independence-era and Mandate-era recipes, but is portrayed by the state as a dish that is both national and a Bedouin tradition,[5] despite it also historically being a dish of the peasants and Bedouins of the neighboring regions of Palestine and Syria.</p>

                  <h2 class="petra">Welcome to Petra</h2>
                  <img class="img3" src="https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/landscape/public/images/methode/2018/05/02/b92139de-42c2-11e8-ab09-36e8e67fb996_1280x720_134359.jpg?itok=FUjvQoqd">
                  <h4 class="petra">first place to visit is Petra for sure</h4>
                  <p>Petra, the great Ancient City that lies half-hidden in the wind-blown landscape in southern Jordan, is one of the world's most treasured Unesco Heritage Sites. Voted by popular ballot in 2007 as one of the 'New Seven Wonders of the World', it has retained its magnetism even through times of strife in the wider region.</p>
                  <h4>Top experiences in Petra:</h4>
                  <h5 class="petra">1-siq</h5>
                  <img class="img4" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4596/27729425189_dfd787d3eb_b.jpg">
                  <p>The 1.2km Siq, or canyon, with its narrow, vertical walls, is undeniably one of the highlights of Petra. The walk through this magical corridor, as it snakes its way towards the hidden city, is one full of anticipation for the wonders ahead – a point not wasted on the Nabataeans, who made the passage into a sacred way, punctuated with sites of spiritual significance.</p>
                <h5 class="petra">2-Royal Tombs</h5>
                <img class="img4" src="https://lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/98b04ee128988f7d5bfdab563755855b-royal-tombs.jpg?fit=crop&w=960&h=416">
                <p>Downhill from the Theatre, the wadi widens to create a larger thoroughfare. To the right, the great massif of Jebel Al Khubtha looms over the valley. Within its west-facing cliffs are burrowed some of the most impressive burial places in Petra, known collectively as the ‘Royal Tombs’. They look particularly stunning bathed in the golden light of sunset.</p>
                <h2 class="rum">Welcome to Wadi Rum</h2> 
                <img class="img4" src="https://t-ec.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1024x768/569/56975394.jpg">
                <p>Wadi Rum is everything you’d expect of a quintessential desert: it is extreme in summer heat and winter cold; it is violent and moody as the sun slices through chiselled siqs (canyons) at dawn or melts the division between rock and sand at dusk; it is exacting on the Bedouin who live in it and vengeful on those who ignore its dangers. For most visitors, on half- or full-day trips from Aqaba or Petra, Wadi Rum offers one of the easiest and safest glimpses of the desert in the region. For the lucky few who can afford a day or two in their itinerary to sleep over at one of the desert camps, it can be an unforgettable way of stripping the soul back to basics. </p> 
               <h2 class="sea">Welcome to Dead Sea</h2>
               <img class="img4" src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/0334dd8d938cb2bf7830e47c5d6a6756/tumblr_onfpmn3FkE1vehqeko1_1280.jpg">
                <p> At 408m below sea level – the lowest point on earth – the Dead Sea is a body of intense blue water, polished smooth like oiled skin on a windless day in winter and ruffled into whitecaps by the summer winds.
                  Dead Sea salts and minerals have long been exploited for their skin-friendly properties. While swimming, the extreme salinity will help you discover cuts you never knew you had (don’t shave beforehand), and be prepared for a few minutes of agony if any water gets in your eyes. 'Swimming’ is actually a misnomer – the buoyancy makes it difficult to do much more than happily bob.</p>
